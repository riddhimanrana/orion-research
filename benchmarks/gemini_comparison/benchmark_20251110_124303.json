      "gemini_response": "Here's a breakdown of the objects and spatial scene in the video:\n\n**Initial Scene:**\n\n*   **Desk:** With two monitors, a keyboard, a wrist rest, a mouse, a laptop, and water bottles on top. The desk appears to be in a room with white walls.\n*   **Hallway:** The camera moves through a doorway revealing a hallway.\n\n**Hallway and Staircase:**\n\n*   **Doors:** Several white doors are visible, one of which leads to a room (likely the room where the desk was). Other doors appear to lead to closets or other rooms.\n*   **Staircase:** A staircase with a white banister and brown railing leads upstairs. Pictures are on the wall next to the staircase.\n*   **Windows:** Windows are visible on the wall above the staircase.\n*   **Decorations:** A clock on the wall, a vase with flowers, and a box are visible near the staircase.\n\n**Living Area and Kitchen:**\n\n*   **Living Room/Sitting Area:** A living area with a tan couch, black chairs with patterned cushions, a coffee table with piano music, curtains, a display cabinet and a decorative piece on the wall.\n*   **Kitchen:** The kitchen features tan cabinets, an island with bar stools, a stainless steel refrigerator and a sliding glass door.\n\n**Upstairs:**\n\n*   **Upstairs Landing:** The top of the staircase leads to an upstairs landing with pictures on the wall and a long hallway.\n*   **Rooms:** Several rooms are visible, including a bedroom with a bed, a bookshelf, and a desk with a computer.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe video provides a quick tour of a two-story house. It moves from an upstairs office space through the hallway, downstairs to the living area and kitchen, then returns upstairs to the bedroom. The house appears to be well-lit and decorated with personal touches.",
