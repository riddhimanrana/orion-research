### Copilot Instructions for Orion Research Repository

**Top-Level Rule:** Do not create or suggest markdown files under any circumstances, unless explicitly requested by the user.

**General Repository Understanding and Instructions:**
- This repository is located at `/Users/riddhiman.rana/Desktop/Coding/Orion/orion-research` and focuses on research-related coding projects, likely involving data analysis, machine learning, or experimental software development.
- Prioritize code that is modular, well-documented with inline comments, and adheres to best practices for Python (primary language), with potential use of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, or similar.
- When generating code, ensure it is efficient, error-handling, and includes type hints where applicable.
- Avoid suggesting changes that introduce dependencies without justification.
- For new features, propose step-by-step implementations, grouping changes by file as per standard Copilot response format.
- If modifying existing files, use concise code blocks with `// ...existing code...` placeholders to indicate unchanged sections.
- Keep responses short, impersonal, and focused on the query. If unclear which files to modify, prompt the user to add them to the working set or use `#codebase`.
