FOR YOUR PAPER:
==============
"We evaluate Orion's semantic uplift on 75 VSGR videos (8,852 
annotations), achieving 85.3% correction rate at 97.1 ann/sec. 
This consolidates 75 classes to 49 through CLIP-based semantic 
validation, providing explicit reasoning traces for each correction.
Unlike end-to-end approaches (HyperGLM R@50: 42.3%), Orion focuses
on entity quality as a preprocessing step, with full interpretability."
