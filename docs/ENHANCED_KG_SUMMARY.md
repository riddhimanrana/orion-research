- Unknown (3 scenes, mixed objects)

Timeline:
1. Workspace (0.0s - 3.7s): keyboard, mouse, tv
2. Unknown (7.5s - 10.5s): person, refrigerator
3. Bedroom (19.8s - 23.6s): person, bed, chair
4. Bedroom (23.8s - 25.0s): person, bed
5. Unknown (25.7s - 27.5s): person, refrigerator
6. Unknown (27.8s - 33.8s): person, tv
7. Bedroom (34.1s - 39.0s): person, bed, cell phone
8. Bedroom (57.9s - 59.7s): person, hair drier, bed
9. Workspace (63.0s - 64.9s): mouse, tv, keyboard
```

### Spatial Relationships
```
Top Relationships (by confidence):
1.00: keyboard ↔ tv (31 co-occurrences)
1.00: keyboard ↔ mouse (30 co-occurrences)
1.00: mouse ↔ tv (30 co-occurrences)
1.00: person ↔ person (151 co-occurrences)
1.00: bed ↔ person (88 co-occurrences)
0.55: chair ↔ bed (11 co-occurrences)
```

### QA System Performance

**Question:** "What type of rooms appear in the video?"
**Answer:** "The video contains Workspace, Bedroom, and Unknown scenes. The Workspace scene includes a keyboard, mouse, and TV. The Bedroom scenes appear multiple times..."

**Question:** "What objects are most common?"
**Answer:** "Based on the automated analysis, the most common objects are people (220 appearances) and beds (59 appearances)..."

**Question:** "What happens in the timeline?"
**Answer:** "The video shows a sequence of scenes... Initially, there's activity in a workspace (0.0s - 3.7s)... Then shifts to a bedroom (19.8s - 25.0s)... Finally, there's a return to a workspace (63.0s - 64.9s)."

## 🔧 Configuration

### Scene Patterns

Add new scene types in `SceneClassifier.SCENE_PATTERNS`:

```python
'new_scene_type': {
    'required': {'object1', 'object2'},  # Must have these
    'common': {'object3', 'object4'},    # Often has these
    'weight': 1.0                         # Importance weight
}
```

### Spatial Thresholds

Adjust in `SpatialAnalyzer.compute_relationship()`:

```python
if norm_distance < 0.15:    # Very near threshold
    return 'very_near', 0.9
elif norm_distance < 0.3:   # Near threshold
    return 'near', 0.7
```

### Causal Parameters

Modify in `CausalReasoningEngine.find_causal_chains()`:

```python
temporal_gap > 5.0          # Max time between cause/effect
proximity < 0.3             # Min spatial proximity required
confidence < 0.5            # Min confidence threshold
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Works Well
1. **Scene classification** - Pattern-based approach is robust and interpretable
2. **Spatial co-occurrence** - Simple but effective for relationship detection
3. **Question type classification** - Keyword matching works surprisingly well
4. **LLM integration** - Gemma 3 4B provides good quality answers

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Bbox-level spatial analysis** - Currently uses co-occurrence; actual bboxes would enable precise positioning
2. **Causal detection** - Needs state change data (requires dynamic scenes)
3. **Scene segmentation** - Could use optical flow or visual similarity for better boundaries
4. **Contextual embeddings** - Currently simplified; could use learned fusion

### Design Decisions
1. **Pattern-based scenes** - Chose interpretability over learned models
2. **Neo4j storage** - Graph database perfect for relationship queries
3. **Modular architecture** - Each component independently testable
4. **Confidence scoring** - All relationships have confidence for filtering
