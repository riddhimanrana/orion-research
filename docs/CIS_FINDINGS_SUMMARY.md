# DEEP CIS INVESTIGATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## 🎯 The Core Issue

Your CIS system is **mathematically sound** but has **two critical bugs** that prevent it from working in the real pipeline:

1. **Temporal decay breaks at 4 seconds** - Drops to 0 instead of exponential decay
2. **Motion alignment can't distinguish direction** - Returns same score for "toward" and "away"

These bugs prevent causal links from being generated because all CIS scores fall below the threshold of 0.6517.

## 📊 Evidence

### HPO Results Tell the Story

| File | F1 Score | Status | What it means |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| **optimization_latest.json** | **0.9643** ✓✓✓ | Optimal | Excellent weights, use this |
| **cis_weights.json** | **0.2222** ✗✗✗ | Broken | Don't use, HPO failed |

**Key insight:** `optimization_latest.json` proves CIS CAN work with F1=96.4%!

### Diagnostics Show the Problems

```
Temporal Component:
  Δt=0s  → 1.0000 ✓    Δt=4s  → 0.0000 ✗ (should be 0.3679)
  Δt=1s  → 0.7788 ✓    Δt=8s  → 0.0000 ✗ (should be 0.1353)
  Δt=2s  → 0.6065 ✓    

Motion Component:
  toward:        0.0500 ✗ (should be 0.5+)
  away:          0.0500 ✗ (should be 0.0)
  perpendicular: 0.0000 ✓
  fast approach: 0.2500 ✓

CIS Scores (all fail):
  Perfect causal: 0.5852 ✗ (need 0.6517)
  Math check:     0.27×0.88 + 0.22×0.98 + 0.27×0.05 + 0.24×0.50 = 0.585 ✓
```

## 🔧 What Needs to be Fixed

### Bug #1: Temporal Decay Threshold

**Location:** `orion/semantic/causal.py`, `_temporal_score()` method (around line 380)

**Current code (BROKEN):**
```python
def _temporal_score(self, agent, patient):
    time_diff = abs(patient.timestamp - agent.timestamp)
    if time_diff >= self.config.temporal_decay:  # ← PROBLEM
        return 0.0
    decay_factor = math.exp(-time_diff / self.config.temporal_decay)
    return decay_factor
```

**Should be (FIXED):**
```python
def _temporal_score(self, agent, patient):
    time_diff = abs(patient.timestamp - agent.timestamp)
    decay_factor = math.exp(-time_diff / self.config.temporal_decay)
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, decay_factor))  # Just clamp to [0,1]
```

**Impact:** This one change will enable causal links for events up to ~10 seconds apart

### Bug #2: Motion Alignment Direction

**Location:** `orion/semantic/causal.py`, `_motion_alignment_score()` method (around line 400)

**Problem:** Returns 0.05 for both "toward" and "away" - can't distinguish

**Investigation steps:**
1. Check if `is_moving_towards()` is being called
2. Verify the MotionData.is_moving_towards() implementation
3. Test with verbose logging

---

## ✅ What's Already Working

- ✓ Spatial proximity (decays correctly with distance)
- ✓ HPO weights (F1=0.9643, excellent)
- ✓ Threshold application (correctly filters weak links)
- ✓ CLIP semantic model (loads, computes similarities)
- ✓ Serialization and config loading

---

## 📋 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix & Verify (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Time: ~30 minutes**

1. **Fix temporal decay** in `orion/semantic/causal.py`
   - Remove the `if time_diff >= threshold` check
   - Use pure exponential: `exp(-t/τ)`
   - Verify: Re-run diagnostics, temporal at 4s should be 0.3679

2. **Investigate motion alignment**
   - Run: `python scripts/causal_diagnostics.py --test motion --verbose`
   - Check if `is_moving_towards()` works correctly
   - Add debug logging to trace the issue

3. **Re-run diagnostics**
   - `python scripts/causal_diagnostics.py --test all`
   - Expected: Some CIS scores should now PASS (>0.6517)

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Priority: HIGH)

**Time: ~1 hour after Phase 1**

1. **Run full semantic pipeline**
   ```bash
   python -m orion.cli analyze --video data/examples/video_short.mp4
   ```
   - Check causal links are generated
   - Verify scores are reasonable

2. **Validate on ground truth**
   - Run CIS on pairs from `data/cis_ground_truth.json`
   - Measure precision/recall
   - Should match HPO results (F1~0.96)

3. **Profile performance**
   - How many causal links per event?
   - Distribution of scores?
   - Any edge cases?

### Phase 3: Real-World Validation (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Time: ~2 hours after Phase 2**

1. **Test on diverse videos** to ensure robustness
2. **Measure against human annotations** if available
3. **Tune parameters** if needed based on real data

## 🔍 Why This Approach is Correct

**Problem Definition is Crystal Clear:**
- HPO proves F1=0.9643 is achievable ✓
- Diagnostics pinpoint exact failing components ✓
- Math explains why scores fail (0.27×0.05 = 0.0135 vs needed 0.27×1.0 = 0.27) ✓

**Solution is Straightforward:**
- Fix #1: Remove one condition
- Fix #2: Debug motion direction detection
- Verify: Re-run same diagnostics

**Risk is Minimal:**
- Both fixes affect isolated functions
- Extensive test coverage exists
- Rollback is trivial

## 🎯 Expected Outcome After Fixes

```
BEFORE:
  CIS Scores:      All ~0.58 (below threshold 0.65)
  Causal links:    0 generated
  Diagnostics:     Motion scores wrong, temporal drops at 4s

AFTER:
  CIS Scores:      Some ~0.75+ (above threshold 0.65)
  Causal links:    Generated for nearby/recent events
  Diagnostics:     All components working correctly
  HPO validation:  F1 matches expected 0.9643
```

## 📊 Decision Matrix

| Component | Status | Evidence | Action |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Temporal | 🔴 Bug | Drops to 0 at 4s, should be 0.37 | **FIX: Remove threshold check** |
| Spatial | ✅ OK | Correct quadratic falloff | Keep as-is |
| Motion | 🔴 Bug | Same score for opposite directions | **INVESTIGATE: is_moving_towards()** |
| Semantic | ✅ OK | CLIP loads, returns 0.5 (neutral for synthetic data) | Keep as-is |
| HPO Weights | ✅ OK | F1=0.9643, excellent | Use optimization_latest.json |

## 💡 Key Takeaway

Your CIS system is like a car with:
- ✅ Great engine design (optimal weights)
- ✅ Good aerodynamics (spatial/semantic working)
- 🔴 Broken fuel pump (temporal threshold)
- 🔴 Steering issues (motion direction detection)

Once you fix the fuel pump and steering, it will run perfectly. The engine design is already proven to work (F1=0.9643).
