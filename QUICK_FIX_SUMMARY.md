# Quick Fix Summary - LLM Query Generation

## Problem
LLM (gemma3:1b) generated **invalid Cypher syntax**:
```
❌ MERGE (e:Entity {id: '1'}) SET e.label = 'Laptop' WHERE e.type = 'Laptop';
                                                      ^^^^^ Can't use WHERE after SET!
```

**Result**: 0 events, 0 relationships, no Q&A context

## Solution
1. **Disabled LLM composition** (set `USE_LLM_COMPOSITION = False`)
2. **Use proven fallback queries** (always syntactically correct)
3. **Added validation** (catches invalid syntax if LLM is re-enabled)

## Changes Made
- `/production/semantic_uplift.py` line 75: Added `USE_LLM_COMPOSITION = False`
- `/production/semantic_uplift.py` lines 712-750: Check LLM flag, validate queries, fallback on error
- `/production/semantic_uplift.py` lines 703-732: Added `validate_cypher_queries()` method

## Expected Results
**Before**:
- ❌ 0/6 queries successful
- ❌ 0 events created
- ❌ 0 relationships
- ❌ Q&A has no context

**After**:
- ✅ ~68/68 queries successful
- ✅ 34 events created
- ✅ 34 relationships created
- ✅ Q&A has temporal context

## Test Now
```bash
./orion analyze data/examples/video1.mp4 -i
```

Look for:
- ✅ "Using fallback query generation (LLM disabled)"
- ✅ "Query execution: 68 successful, 0 failed"
- ✅ "event_nodes: 34"
- ✅ "relationships: 34"

## Why This Matters
Without events and relationships, the Q&A system only knows:
- "book appears 70 times" ❌

With events and relationships, it can answer:
- "book moved from desk to bag at 10.5s" ✅
- "book's last location was in the backpack" ✅
- "book changed state 3 times during the video" ✅
